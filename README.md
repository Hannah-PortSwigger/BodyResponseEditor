# BodyResponseEditor
Creates a new response tab in Burp's message editors that displays the response line (HTTP version + status code) along with the body.

## Usage
1. Load the extension
2. View a response in any tool
3. Change response view to "Only body" tab

## Build
A JAR file is provided under `build/libs`.
However, we would recommend building this extension yourself.
